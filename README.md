# Decorator Pattern

The following text was obtained from the book [Head First Desing Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Eric-Freeman/dp/0596007124).

### Desing principles

* Clases should be open for extension, closed to modification

**Be careful when choosing the areas of code that need to be extended; applying the OPEN-CLOSED principle everywhere is wasteful and unnecesary, and can lead to complex, hard-to-understad code**

### The decorator pattern

When we got class explosions and rigid desings we should use the decorator pattern, but how to decorate a object? firstly think about the decorator objects as "wrappers".



The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 

Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
